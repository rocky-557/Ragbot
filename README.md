# RAG Implementation with LLaMA LLM Using Groq

This project provides an implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using the LLaMA language model (LLM) and Groq. The RAG architecture combines dense retrieval with generative language modeling to create a powerful question-answering system. In this implementation, Groq accelerates the LLaMA LLM, enabling high-performance inference.

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models use an external retriever to fetch relevant documents from a knowledge base, and a generative language model (like LLaMA) to generate responses based on both the retrieved documents and the input query. This implementation leverages the Groq platform for efficient inference, enhancing the speed and scalability of the LLaMA LLM.

## Features

- **Dense Retrieval**: Uses a dense retriever for retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base.
- **Groq Acceleration**: Accelerates inference using Groq for high-performance processing.
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup and configuration for different datasets and use cases.
- **Scalable**: Supports scaling across multiple Groq chips for larger workloads.

## Prerequisites

Before using this implementation, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3**: The code is written in Python, so a compatible version is required.
- **Groq SDK**: You need the Groq SDK installed on your machine. Visit the [Groq website](https://groq.com/) for more information.
- **Dependencies**: Install required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-llama-groq.git
    cd rag-llama-groq
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set Up Groq SDK:**
    Follow the instructions from the [Groq SDK documentation](https://groq.com/docs/sdk) to set up the environment.
